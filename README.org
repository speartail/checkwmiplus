* check_wmi_plus

Check WMI Plus is a client-less Nagios (and other monitoring systems that support the Nagios protocol) plugin for checking Windows systems.

[[http://www.edcint.co.nz/checkwmiplus/][Upstream]] only distributes releases as tarballs so I created this repository to make it a little easier to track changes - this is *not* a fork.
